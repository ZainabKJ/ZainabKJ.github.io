Welcome to my github page!

It starts out with the learning about Github follwing to what it refers to and the features needed to create the webpage in the about page.

Following it, there are two different blogs, the first one referring to lauching of the site while the second one helps to get a more detailed information based on 
github.

There have been addition of images as well on a few pages to enhance its features and make it more interesting.
